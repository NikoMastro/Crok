Crok' Project - README

#Overview#

Crok' is a web application designed to assist pet owners in tracking and managing their pets' nutritional needs and overall well-being. Initially developed during a two-week project at Le Wagon, Crok' has been reworked and expanded for personal use. The app aims to simplify pet care by providing tailored food recommendations, tracking health records, managing vet appointments, and more.
